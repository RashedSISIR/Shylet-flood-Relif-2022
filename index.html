      <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
      <p>
        We always tried to enlarge a helping hand to the victims who are
        becoming affected and damaged by natural calamities in different times.
        Another purpose of this relief distribution program is to facilitate the
        post-flood rehabilitation function in these affected areas.

        <h1>Emergency Food and Water Supplies</h1>
        <p>
          Food is vital to families in order for them to stay healthy while
          having the energy to continue fighting and rebuilding their lives.
          Your donations will provide them with enough food to sustain them,
          helping them to feel as though they have a chance of standing strong
          once again. Your donations will also enable them to have access to
          fresh drinking water. We all understand just how important water is to
          our health and it is vital that everyone remains suitably hydrated.

        <h1>Shelter for a family</h1>
        <p>
          As homes have been damaged and torn apart, families have nowhere to
          live but your donations can provide them with a basic shelter that
          keeps them safe and out of the rain. This will lift their spirits and
          help them to feel as though they have a home that they can rebuild
          from

        <h1>Education for a child</h1>
        <p>
          Children should be taught to avoid water when unsupervised. After a
          storm occurs, puddles are natural temptations, but creeks, ditches,
          basically any area overflowing with water can be dangerous. Water does
          not always indicate its depth, and what looks like a shallow puddle
          may be a hole, several feet deep.
